#Exercise Tracker - Cell Phone Based Exercise Tracking System
**Exercise Tracker** is a Flutter mobile application used for recognizing five types of users' physical activities (walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, running, standing). 

The raw data generated by the built-in accelerometer and gyroscope of a smartphone are used as the inputs of a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model. 

After requiring the user to input the workout type before tracking for several times, the app will be able to identify the workout types and record the workout details based on the results returned by the LSTM model.
